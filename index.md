## Bio

Yevgeniy Dodis is a Fellow of the IACR (International Association for Cryptologic Research), and a Professor of Computer Science at New York University. Dr. Dodis received his summa cum laude Bachelors degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from New York University in 1996, and his PhD degree in Computer Science from MIT in 2000.  Dr. Dodis was a post-doc at IBM T.J.Watson Research center in 2000, and joined New York University in 2001. 

Dr. Dodis' research is primarily in cryptography and network security. He worked in a variety of areas, including random number generation, secure messaging, leakage-resilient cryptography, cryptography under weak randomness, cryptography with biometrics and other noisy data, hash function and block cipher design, protocol composition and information-theoretic cryptography.

In addition to being an IACR Fellow, Dr. Dodis is the recipient of 2021 and 2019 IACR Test-of-Time Awards for his work on Fuzzy Extractors and Verifiable Random Functions, National Science
Foundation CAREER Award, Faculty Awards from Facebook, Google, IBM, Algorand and VMware, and Best Paper Award at 2005 Public Key Cryptography Conference. As an undergraduate student, he was also a winner of the US-Canada Putnam Mathematical Competition in 1995.

Dr. Dodis has more than 150 scientific publications at various top venues, was the Program co-Chair for the 2022 CRYPTO and 2015 Theory of Cryptography Conference, the editor of Journal of Cryptology (2012-2019), has been on program committees of many international conferences (including FOCS, STOC, CRYPTO and Eurocrypt), and gave numerous invited lectures and courses at various venues.
